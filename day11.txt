--combinations on different columns
--deptno,job and sum(sal)
-- group by
select deptno, sum(sal)
from emp
group by deptno
order by 1;

select deptno, job, sum(sal)
from emp
    group by deptno, job
order by 1,2;

A GROUPING SETS expression allows you to selectively define one or more grouping sets in a query.
-- grouping sets 
select deptno, job, sum(sal)
from emp
group by 
 grouping sets (
    (deptno,job),
    (deptno),
    (job),
    ()
 )
order by 1,2;


select deptno, job, sum(sal)
from emp
group by 
 grouping sets (
    (deptno,job),
    ()
 )
order by 1,2;





The CUBE is an extension of the GROUP BY clause that allows you to generate grouping sets for all possible combinations of dimensions.
--cube -in this we are not allow to pick and choose the combinations
select deptno, job, sum(sal)
from emp
group by 
   cube(deptno,job)
order by 1,2;


The ROLLUP is an extension of the GROUP BY clause. The ROLLUP calculates multiple levels of subtotals across a group of columns (or dimensions) along with the grand total.
The ROLLUP works as follows:
First, calculate the standard aggregate values in the GROUP BY clause.
Then, progressively create higher-level subtotals of the grouping columns, which are col2 and col1 columns, from right to left.
Finally, calculate the grand total.

--rollup
select deptno, job, sum(sal)
from emp
group by 
   rollup(deptno,job)
order by 1,2;
